            <h3>The Bund</h3>
            <p>It'll be hard to go to SHanghai and not visit The Bund. It'll likely be one of your first stops. Walk next to the buildings of yester-year while looking across the river at the Shanghai skyline.  </p>

            <h3>Xuhui Riverside Park</h3>
            <p>This one's off the tourist radar but is one of my favourite places in the city. Once and old shipping port, it has now been transformed into a long riverside park complete with climbing walls, grass areas and a skatepark. Bring some beers and grab a spot on the grass. </p>

            <p>For those looking for a bit of art and culture, this is a fantastic setting. An old power building turned museum, hosting some of the bigger exhibits which come through. Look out for any shows by Cai Guo-Qiang. Always a treat </p>

            <p>I'm not sure what I like the most about this place; the food, the black beer, or the crazy music/dance party that happens mid meal. Goat is definitely the specialtiy here and there is lots of it - they'll even give youu plastic gloves so you can shovel it into your mouth. </p>
